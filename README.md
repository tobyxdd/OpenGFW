Free and open-source censorship for everyone.

[The Great Firewall of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall) is arguably the largest Internet censorship system in the world. It is technically an interesting and sophisticated system that includes real-time analysis and blocking/hijacking of various protocols, active probing of proxies & VPNs, TLS MITM attack and many more on a mass scale. Why letting only the Chinese government have this capability? With this project, you can now easily deploy your own GFW on your home network to, say, block your kids from using TikTok!

## Why?

For fun. And it's how I learn computer networking. Even better if it's actually useful to you.
